This program is designed to record videos simultaneously using two or more iPhones’ cameras. 
Each iPhone must have its time synchronized with the server before use. 
Then the program (“Alarm Camera”) starts recording at the scheduled time. 

It is a simple program and has not been thoroughly tested for bugs.
